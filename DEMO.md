# MedProof Demo Guide

## üè• Privacy-Preserving Medical Research Platform

MedProof enables hospitals to collaborate on medical research without exposing patient data using zero-knowledge proofs and blockchain technology.

## üöÄ Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 16+
- npm or yarn

### Setup & Run Demo
```bash
# 1. Run setup script (installs dependencies)
./scripts/setup.sh

# 2. Start demo
./scripts/demo.sh

# Or run manually:
npm run dev
```

### Access Points
- **Frontend Dashboard**: http://localhost:3000
- **Backend API**: http://localhost:3001
- **Health Check**: http://localhost:3001/health

## üìä Demo Walkthrough

### 1. Main Dashboard
- View participating hospitals
- See system statistics
- Navigate to hospital-specific dashboards

### 2. Hospital Dashboard
Access any hospital (e.g., Metropolitan General Hospital):

**Step 1: Connect to FHIR**
- Simulates connection to hospital's EHR system
- Uses public FHIR test servers for demonstration

**Step 2: Generate Patient Cohort**
- Creates synthetic patient data matching research criteria
- Configurable condition and sample size
- Realistic demographic distributions

**Step 3: Create Zero-Knowledge Proof**
- Generates cryptographic proof of study results
- Proves statistical significance without revealing patient data
- Shows treatment efficacy and sample sizes in ranges

**Step 4: Submit to Blockchain** (Demo)
- Simulates blockchain submission
- Creates immutable record of research findings

### 3. Research Aggregator
- View multi-hospital studies
- Analyze aggregated results across institutions
- Verify zero-knowledge proofs
- Privacy-preserving statistical analysis

## üîí Privacy Features Demonstrated

### Zero-Knowledge Proofs
- **Sample Size Verification**: Proves minimum patient count without exact numbers
- **Treatment Efficacy**: Proves effectiveness rates within ranges
- **Statistical Significance**: Proves p-values meet thresholds
- **Data Integrity**: Cryptographically verifies results authenticity

### FHIR Integration
- Standards-compliant healthcare data exchange
- Secure connection simulation to EHR systems
- Patient data extraction following HIPAA guidelines
- Anonymization and de-identification processes

### Multi-Hospital Aggregation
- Combine research findings from multiple sites
- Statistical analysis without sharing raw data
- Heterogeneity assessment across institutions
- Confidence intervals and effect size calculations

## üß™ Technical Architecture

### Smart Contracts
- **MedicalResearchRegistry.sol**: Core proof storage and verification
- Hospital authorization and proof submission
- Study aggregation and result verification

### ZK Circuits
- **medical_stats.circom**: Combined medical statistics proof
- **range_proof.circom**: Value range verification
- **statistical_significance.circom**: P-value and sample size proofs

### Backend Services
- **Synthetic Data Generation**: Realistic medical datasets
- **FHIR Connector**: Healthcare system integration
- **Proof Generator**: Zero-knowledge proof creation
- **API Server**: RESTful endpoints for all operations

### Frontend Dashboard
- **React + TypeScript**: Modern web interface
- **Material-UI**: Professional healthcare UI components
- **Recharts**: Statistical visualization
- **Real-time Updates**: Live proof generation and verification

## üéØ Demo Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Diabetes Treatment Study
1. Generate cohorts from 3 hospitals
2. Each hospital creates ZK proof of treatment efficacy
3. Aggregate results show overall treatment effectiveness
4. No individual hospital data is revealed

### Scenario 2: Multi-Site Drug Trial
1. Different hospitals test same treatment
2. Various sample sizes and demographics
3. Statistical significance proven across sites
4. Regulatory compliance demonstrated

### Scenario 3: Population Health Research
1. Diverse patient populations across hospitals
2. Demographic diversity verification
3. Health outcome disparities analysis
4. Privacy-preserving epidemiological insights
