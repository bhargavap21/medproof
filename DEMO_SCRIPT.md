# MedProof Demo Script (2 Minutes)

## üéØ **Opening Hook (0:00-0:15)**
*"What if researchers could prove their medical findings are valid without exposing any patient data? Meet MedProof - the privacy-preserving medical research platform built on Midnight Network."*

---

## üè• **Dashboard Overview (0:15-0:45)**

### Show Dashboard Features:
- **"This is our research collaboration dashboard where hospitals, researchers, and organizations work together"**
- Point out key metrics: Hospital network, study requests, ZK proofs generated
- **"Notice we have X hospitals connected and Y privacy-preserving proofs generated"**

### Highlight Study Request Platform:
- **"Instead of months of negotiations, researchers can create study requests and get competitive hospital bids in weeks"**
- **"All with automated matching and privacy-preserving patient count verification"**

## üî¨ **Core Feature Demo (0:45-1:30)**

### Navigate to ZK Proof Generator:
- Click on "ZK Proof Generator" in sidebar
- **"Here's where the magic happens - generating zero-knowledge proofs"**

### Select a Study:
- Choose from available studies (e.g., "Metformin Efficacy Study")
- **"I'll select this completed diabetes study from Stanford Medical Center"**
- Show study details: patient count, efficacy results, quality metrics

### Generate ZK Proof:
- Click "Generate ZK Proof"
- **"Watch as we create a cryptographic proof that validates this study's results"**
- **"The proof confirms the statistical significance WITHOUT revealing any patient data"**
- Show the proof generation process and success message

## üìä **Results & Analytics (1:30-1:50)**

### Navigate to Results Page:
- **"Once generated, proofs are submitted to the Midnight Network blockchain"**
- Show the research results with:
  - Treatment efficacy metrics
  - Statistical validation
  - Clinical significance
  - Blockchain transaction details

### Analytics Dashboard:
- **"Our analytics dashboard shows all verified proofs across the network"**
- **"Researchers can see proven treatment efficacies while patient privacy remains intact"**

## üé¨ **Demo Tips:**

### Before You Start:
- Have the app running on localhost
- Pre-load the dashboard with sample data
- Test the ZK proof generation flow
- Prepare backup talking points if technical issues occur

### During Demo:
- **Speak confidently and clearly**
- **Use "we" language to include the audience**
- **Point to specific UI elements as you explain**
- **Keep moving - don't pause for technical delays**

### Key Messages to Emphasize:
1. **Privacy-first** - Patient data never leaves hospitals
2. **Speed** - Weeks instead of months for study setup
3. **Trust** - Cryptographic proofs can't be faked
4. **Network effect** - More hospitals = more research opportunities

### Backup Slides (if technical issues):
- Prepared screenshots of key features
- Architecture diagram showing ZK proof flow
- Market opportunity and problem statement
