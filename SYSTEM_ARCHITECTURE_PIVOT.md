# MedProof System Architecture Pivot

## Executive Summary

This document outlines the strategic pivot from a research simulation platform to a **real-world privacy-preserving medical research infrastructure** that connects pharmaceutical companies, research organizations, and hospitals through zero-knowledge proofs and FHIR-compliant data standards.

## Current System Limitations

### Problems with the Existing Approach
- **Simulated Data**: Currently generates mock patient data instead of using real medical records
- **Parameter Manipulation**: Researchers can adjust study parameters after seeing results
- **Generic Proofs**: ZK proofs only validate statistical significance without study context
- **No Real Medical Value**: Results don't represent actual clinical studies or patient outcomes

### Technical Issues Identified
```javascript
// Current ZK proof only includes generic statistics
publicSignals: [
    BigInt(1), // Proof validity indicator
    BigInt(privateData.patientCount >= 50 ? 1 : 0), // Sample size
    BigInt(privateData.pValue <= 50 ? 1 : 0), // Statistical significance
    BigInt(treatmentSuccessRate), // Treatment success rate
    BigInt(timestamp)
]
// Missing: study protocol, patient demographics, treatment specifics
```

## Proposed System Architecture

### Core Concept: Pre-Defined Study Registry

Instead of researchers creating arbitrary studies, the system enables:

1. **Organizations request hospitals to conduct specific studies**
2. **Hospitals execute IRB-approved research protocols**
3. **Real patient data is collected following standardized procedures**
4. **ZK proofs validate study results without exposing patient information**
5. **Researchers access aggregated insights across multiple hospitals**

## System Components
